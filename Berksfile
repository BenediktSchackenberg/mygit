# This is a Berkshelf configuration file. It can be used to declare community
# and third-party cookbook dependencies. You can install Berkshelf via the
# command line by typing:
#
#   $ gem install berkshelf
#
# For more information on Berkshelf, see the documentation at
# http://berkshelf.com/

# This declares the default location to search for cookbooks. The key :opscode
# tells Berkshelf to search community.opscode.com for cookbooks. For a list of
# other valid keys, see the Berkshelf documentation
site :opscode

# Example usage
# -------------

# Uncomment to download the latest apache2 cookbook from the community site.
# cookbook "apache2"

# Uncomment to download a specific version of the nginx cookbook from
# the community site. The ~> is called a pessimistic version
# constraint. It will pick up any additional patch (bug) releases, but
# will keep the minor version locked at 101. In other words, 0.101.X.
# cookbook "nginx", "~> 0.101.5"

# Berkshelf also allows you to define git locations. Uncomment the following line
# to download the latest master branch from github for this cookbook.
# cookbook "mysql", :git => "https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/mysql.git"

# Especially for local development, it's helpful to use a local path location.
# Uncomment to point at a local cookbook on the filesystem, relative to the
# current working directory.
# cookbook "myserver", :path => "/code/myserver-cookbook"
